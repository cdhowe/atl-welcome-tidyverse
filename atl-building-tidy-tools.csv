10/15/2019 17:04:52,5,4,4,8,3,I liked the chunks of time where we had the opportunity to work through the problems,"I found it really difficult to keep track of the things that just go directly into the console, so it would be great to have a cheatsheet of the necessary steps provided explicitly","Not really? I think it covered essentially what I was expecting, but we spent a lot more time on things I wouldn't have expected, like dates and datetimes.","The pink/green post-it notes were a great but underused idea and the live coding was extremely quick so it would have been more helpful to go a bit more slowly over the code as it was being written. Once we scrolled up far enough, it was gone!"
10/15/2019 17:08:25,5,4,5,10,4,Broad range of topics discussed,"The tidyverse is changing as developers continue to improve it, but that makes it hard to stay up to date and maybe hard to teach content as well. For example, rlang's new {{}} convention wasn't well known and it seems like continuous re-writing core pieces of the tidyverse will make it less useful to attend tidyverse workshops (because the info you learn may become deprecated in the next year).",Nope ,"Nothing! Thank you so much. I have used R for awhile and I really appreciate the way that tidy principles are changing standard practice. I also got a chance to meet Hadley, Jenny, Sara, Charlotte, and many other participants in the workshop, and appreciated how friendly and inclusive everyone was. "

10/15/2019 21:34:11,5,5,5,10,5,"Day 1 of package development followed by day 2 of practicing the package development several times is a game changer for me. The pre-packaged material with slides and topic (packages dev, testing) was excellent!","Some of the case studying on function types/invariance and function implementation seemed redundant after several studies. Did not have same provide same excitement/energy as Day 1 topics. However, with this part of implementation being nuanced, I will not be surprised if these 2nd day topics turn out to be a big benefit moving forward.  ",No. ,"A couple of thoughts for improvement (1) covered in practice many packages that are crucial/helpful - might be beneficial to make this learning explicit.  For example, ""here are tricks using stringr, usethis, etc ""(2) a larger social component would a benefit - was tricky with limited time during lunch to network - maybe a slack channel for introductions, link sharing, general networking, etc.  Thank you! Overall a great workshop!"

10/16/2019 5:48:28,4,4,5,9,5,Practical Hands on Experience,Would have preferred less time spent on discussion items,"I was hoping for some coverage of working with teams via git. We received a lot of best practices that will support working as a team, but I feel like we missed that part of the workflow.","I really enjoyed the style of Hadley's presentation. Live coding, best practices, hands on experience. I definitely learned a lot and the content is extremely valuable for someone who hasn't done some of the legwork themselves to learn about packages. As someone who had, I feel like I learned some good tricks and best practices and some more efficient workflows. Definitely still valuable, but I was hoping to walk away with a bit more. It's your fault for having produced so much documentation :)"
