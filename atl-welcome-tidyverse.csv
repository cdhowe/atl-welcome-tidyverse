Sessions were about the right time in length with breaks well placed.  The colored sticky note idea is brilliant!,"The workshop did not cover topics as advertised in the description.  Namely, the website said that ""Fit models with base R"" and ""Document your work reproducibly with R Markdown,"" however these were not discussed.  Using an R Markdown file and showing how to knit without explanation of what it is, how it's used, different knitting methods, (in my opinion) did not cover the topic.  I would bet that most people in the class have no idea they were using Markdown, did not remember knitting the file, and did not fully understand what that format encourages reproducibility.  Modeling was not covered at all.","3 (Fit models with base R) and 4 (Document your work reproducibly with R Markdown) from the workshop description were not covered.  Personally, I would like to see a full workshop illustrating how to fully utilize R Markdown and modeling.  I am disappointed these two topics were not discussed.","In the future, I would recommend the following:
1) Create a beginner and intermediate introduction session.  The content covered today was perfect for a beginning and covering #1 & 2 would be appropriate.  For the intermediate, I would recommend more advanced things.  Discuss more detailed customization of plots (including situations where more customization is better), modeling with tidyverse, and provide a more detailed description of how to maximize the use of R Markdown.

2) I would be interested in seeing more tidyverse packages besides dplyr.  Maybe put that in an intermediate class?

3) I would like to see a Shiny workshop.  I didn't feel ready for developing "
